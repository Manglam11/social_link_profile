## Overview

- This is project to basically practice "alignment" properties.
- We basically create 2 main div and align items perfectly on them.
- We also ensure best padding and margin values for each item so that page will look professional.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## my-process

### Built with

- Pure HTML
- Pure CSS

### What I learned

- This is an very exiting jouney makeing a website through pure html and css.
- Means deciding no. of div element inside another div element is preety interesting.
- After that setting the margin and padding value for each element is also fun.

I like this part of my code a lot:

```css
.grid {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 10px 90px;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 7px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  font-weight: 700;
  opacity: 0.7;
  transition: font-size 0.3s ease;
}

.grid:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```
